This study examined how different characteristics influence individuals' prosocial choice.

Built upon partner choice theories, the current study tried to examine the underlying evaluative mechanisms that support selective prosocial behaviour. Specifically, we tested how different types of characteristics influence individuals' selective helping behaviour. Therefore, the IVs and DVS are as below:

IVs: type of characteristic (6 levels: helpful, generous, prestigious, considerate, attractive, intelligent), type of question (3 levels: prosocial, social, non-social general)

DV: choice between two characters described; confidence rating of the choice on a 5-point scale


- Coding: For the forced-choice question, choosing the positive character was coded as 1, and choosing the negative character coded as 0. Respondings on confidence-rating questions was coded following the 5-point Likert-scale such that a higher score means higher confidence. 

- Analysis of forced-choice questions: An omnibus analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted to determine the effects of type of characteristic and type of question on the choice. Then post-hoc t-tests was performed to determine the differences.

- Analyses of Confidence-rating questions: An omnibus analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted to determine the effects of type of characteristic and type of question on the confidence rating. Then post-hoc t-tests was performed to determine the differences.
